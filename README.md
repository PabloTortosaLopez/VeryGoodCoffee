# Very Good Coffee

A random Coffee images app built with [Flutter][flutter_link] for [VeryGoodVentures][vgv_link]

## Getting Started üöÄ

To run the desired project either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
$ flutter run
```
or
```sh
$ flutter -d your_device_id run
```

_\*Very Good Coffee works on iOS and Android devices._

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov][lcov_link].

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/
# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
**NOTE:** To run all unit and widget tests of a package, use the same command from inside that package or use the Test Explorer of Visual Studio Code to run all test at once

## Localization (abbr. as L10N) üåê

This project is setup to translate all string content and adjust layouts to match expectations for a user's device locale.
This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in the `lib/l10n/arb` directory.

#### Adding new English strings to the project (Same for any other language as the Spanish (`app_es.arb`))

To add new strings to the project, add an entry to the `app_en.arb` file. Each entry requires:

- A _key-value_ pair -- the **key** should be a short camelCase name for the string, and the **value** is the string itself.
- A matching dictionary entry to provide some flavor text in the form of a description comment.

A complete entry in the English file for a new string looks like this:

```
-- app_en.arb --
{
    "sampleKey": "Very Good Coffee",
    "@sampleKey": {
        "description": "The title of the application"
    }
}
```
```
-- app_es.arb --
{
    "sampleKey": "Un muy buen caf√©",
    "@sampleKey": {
        "description": "El t√≠tulo de la aplicaci√≥n"
    }
}
```

Each additional locale must be added to the `supportedLocales` property when configuring the top level `MaterialApp`.

#### Retrieving localized strings in code

To retrieve strings in code, we need to import the generated `AppLocalizations` class for compiler-safe references.

```
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
```

Then, given a `BuildContext context`, localized string values are retrieved in one line using the string key you specified in `app_en.arb` and any other language file:

```
final localizedString = AppLocalizations.of(context).stringKey
```
